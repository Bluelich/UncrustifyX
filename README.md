# UncrustifyX
[Uncrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net) utility and documentation browser for Mac OS X
## Purpose
UncrustifyX aims to make it easier to browse the hundreds of options available for the Uncrustify utility. 
The documentation browser categorizes the options and provides easy searching and filtering. It can also show a live preview of applying an option on a code sample. 

Additionally, UncrustifyX allows importing and exporting of Uncrustify .cfg files, and provides a GUI to run a configuration set on a list of files, or direct source code input.
